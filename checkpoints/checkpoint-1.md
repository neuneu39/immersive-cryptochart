# Checkpoint 1 （二日目）

## テックメンターが下記の項目を実装します：

* [ ] [Explain] Component Structure
  * [ ] [Explain] Solution Test Cases in `DashBoard.spec.js`
  * [ ] [Explain] Solution Test Cases for new components (Header, Footer, Content, Chart, and Metric)
* [ ] [Review] What the 2 API calls are
  * [ ] https://api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/ticker/${ticker}/?convert=${target}
  * [ ] https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/histominute?fsym=${cryptocurrency}&tsym=${target}&limit=1440
* [ ] [Live Coding] Use the Fetch API to make the requests from the browser to [cryptocompare](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/ )

## 下記の項目を実装してみよう：

* [ ] Add the API calls to your code!
  * [ ] Use the [Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/ja/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) and [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/ja/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) docs as needed
  * [ ] **TIP**: Think about where you want to add the API calls, and where to store the data.
  * [ ] At the end of this checkpoint, you want to know that you have the API data in your app somewhere. Which component will hold the data?
